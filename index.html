                    <h2>about me</h2>
                    <p>I'm an <span class="mark">editor</span> by education (after Polish philology at the University of Wrocław), 
                        I also completed postgraduate studies in <span class="mark">typography</span> (AKT in Warsaw).</p>
                    <p>In 2017 I started to learn coding on my own and for almost 2 years I was <span class="mark">implementing websites</span>.
                        At that time I became 
                        interested in users experiences. Because I also love reading and learning
                        <span class="mark">psychology 
                        and sociology</span>, I'm very excited about human behaviour and I like to ask "why?", I realized that everything I know, what 
                        interests me and what I would like to learn, fits beautifully to move towards
                        <span class="mark">UX</span>. So I did.</p>
                    <p>Now I am employed by a well-known advertising agency, where 
                        I work for <span class="mark">clients such as Microsoft and P&G</span>.
                        I also work as a <span class="mark">proofreader</span> in a magazine about designing digital products. Now my main aim is to engage myself 
                        more in <span class="mark">research</span>, as something that I consider as my absolute dream job, that will maybe 
                        make me more truly useful for myself and for others.
                    </p>
                    <p>Privately I'm interested in 
                        <span class="mark">speedway</span>, 
                        <span class="mark">criminal stories</span>,
                        <span class="mark">strolling</span>
                        and <span class="mark">engaging talks</span> (I like to mix the last two). I collect
                        <span class="mark">books with nice covers</span>. 
                        I have a very special place in my heart for <span class="mark">animals</span> (all animals in general, 
                        but most of all I love dogs, especially Pekingese).
